### Final Recruiter Recommendation:
While the shortlisted candidates possess strong technical skills and relevant experiences, there are notable gaps that need addressing before moving forward in the hiring process. The consistency in high scores suggests a strong overall pool, but candidates must demonstrate specific deployment experiences, automation skills, and project details to significantly enhance their fit for the role. I recommend scheduling follow-up interviews with candidates 0 and 1, as their expertise aligns closely with the job requirements. Additionally, we should encourage candidates to prepare examples that better showcase their practical impact in previous roles. This will help us make a more informed hiring decision and ensure the selected candidate is fully equipped to meet the demands of the position.
